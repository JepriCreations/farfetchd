## Features

- **AI-powered body creation**: Create the body of your request with ease using Farfetchd's AI integration powered by [Ollama](https://ollamalab.com/). There's no need to write JSON or form-data by hand.
- **Cross-platform usage**: Use Farfetchd directly from your browser, no need for a specific operating system.
- **Easy to use**: Farfetchd is designed to be simple and intuitive for simple APIs testing.
- **CORS issue solver**: Farfetchd comes with a built-in CORS issue solver. Use the [Farfetchd Extension](https://github.com/JepriCreations/farfetchd-cors) to bypass the CORS issue when testing APIs locally. The extension will be available in the Extensions Store soon.
- **Light and Dark theme**: Are you in the dark side? Or are you in the light side? Automatically theme base on your system theme configuration.
